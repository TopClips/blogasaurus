1. [Maccy](https://github.com/p0deje/Maccy) is a lightweight clipboard manager for macOS and lifesaver tool for me. It keeps the history of what you copy and lets you quickly navigate, search, and use previous clipboard contents.

2. [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) installs [the stuff you need](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/ "List of Homebrew packages") that Apple (or your Linux system) didn’t provide. It is **The Missing Package Manager for macOS.** After installing Homebrew you can simply install software with single command line so “To install, drag this icon…” no more.

```bash
brew install --cask firefox chrome postman dbeaver
```

   With Above command we can install any [software](https://formulae.brew.sh/) in one go.
